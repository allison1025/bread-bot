# Breadbot: Automated Waste Receipt Analytics ü•ê

## Overview:

**Breadbot** was built to help bakeries track their daily waste without the hassle of manual data entry. The tool automatically reads receipt images from emails, extracts key information, and organises the processed data into a Google Spreadsheet.


## Motivation:
As a former barista at the bakery, I noticed a recurring problem. Every closing shift, we'd send pictures of waste count receipts to store managers, but it felt like these counts weren't making a difference - we kept throwing out tons of pastries and bread. This was just one more task in our already-busy closing routine.


## Approach:
### Breadbot has streamlined this inventory management process. At closing time, Breadbot will:

1. Identify waste data from receipt pictures or email message
2. Read waste counts for each menu item  
3. Update the inventory Google Sheet  
4. Refresh data visualizations instantly  

### Breadbot incorporates data science and backend development technologies, including:

- Python
- Google Email and Sheets APIs
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Crontab for automation


## Future Work:
While Breadbot is customised for a specific business, I am working to make this easily adaptable for any store having similar food waste tracking needs, as I believe in making technology more inclusive and accessible.
